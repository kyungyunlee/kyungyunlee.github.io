## 0. Key ideas
DSP #1 was about performing fourier analysis for the continous time signal. Now, time for discrete time signals. 

### 1. DTFT 

DTFT evaluates discrete-time aperiodic signals. 

Compared to CTFT : 

* CTFT is for continuous-time aperiodic signal. It has a frequency range $$ (-\infty, \infty) $$. Any frequency can exist. 

  $$
  X(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x(t)e^{-j\omega_0t}dt
  $$
  

* DTFT has frequency range $$ 2\pi $$. Thus DTFT is periodic, which means that there can only be a limited value of frequency that can exist. However, frequency values are still continous within the $$ 2\pi $$ range.

$$
X(\omega) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x[n]e^{-j\omega n}
$$

$$
x[n] = \frac{1}{2\pi} \int_{-\pi}^{\pi} X(\omega)e^{j\omega n}d\omega
$$

### 2. z-transform 

z-transform is a more general version of DTFT. DTFT don't always exist/converge, since it cannot be computed for signals that are not stable. However, z-transform can. 

Let $z^n$ be an eigenfunction of a discrete-time LTI system. ($$ e^{jwn} $$ is that of a continuous-time LTI system)

$$
x[n] = z^n
$$

$$
y[n] = \sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}h[k]x[n-k] = H(z)z^n
$$

$H(z)$ is called a transfer function and is a complex number. 

Z-transform is : 

$$
X(z) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} x[n]z^{-n}
$$

This equals to DTFT when $$ z=e^{j\omega} $$, meaning that DTFT is when z value is on a unit circle in the z-plane. This is also the reason why DTFT is $$ 2\pi $$ periodic.

The benefit of z-transform is that it can be used to evaluate systems that are not stable (ex. feedback loop).

#### Properties of z-transform

$$
x[k] \Leftrightarrow X(z)
$$

Time reversal 

$$
x[-k] \Leftrightarrow X(\frac{1}{z})
$$

Time shift 

$$
x[k-k_0] \Leftrightarrow z^{-k_0}X(z)
$$

Exponential sequence 

$$
\alpha^k x[k] \Leftrightarrow X(\frac{z}{\alpha})
$$

z-domain differentiation 

$$
kx[k] \Leftrightarrow -z\frac{d}{dz}X(z)
$$

#### Region of convergence (ROC)

If $$ z=re^{j\omega} $$, then z-tranform looks like DTFT applied to $$ x[n]r^{-n} $$.  

$$
X(z) = X(re^{j\omega}) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} (x[n]r^{-n})e^{-jwn} = DTFT(x[n]r^{-n})
$$

Thus, we can say that z-tranform converges if 

$$
\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty} \lvert x[n]r^{-n} \rvert < \infty
$$

If ROC includes the unit circle, we say the system is stable. 

#### Poles and zeros 

$$
X(z) = \frac{N(z)}{D(z)}
$$

$$ N(z) = 0 $$ are zeros, $$ D(z) = \infty $$ are poles.

### 3. DFT 

More appropriate name is discrete fourier series. DFT analyzes finite and periodic digital input signal x. The resulting frequency domain is discrete (unlike DTFT).  

Compare DTFT with DFT. 

$$
X(\omega) = \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x[n]e^{-j\omega n}
$$

$$
X[k] = \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} x[n]e^{-jk\frac{2\pi}{N}n}
$$

These two are almost equivalent, when $$ \omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N} $$. Also, unlike DTFT, input x[n] is finite/periodic. 

In other words, we can interprete DFT as DTFT sampled in the frequency domain at $$ \omega = \frac{2\pi k}{N} $$ interval. 

DFT can be computed via matrix multiplication:

A faster algorithm of DFT is FFT.
