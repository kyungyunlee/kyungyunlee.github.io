I am a 3rd-year Ph.D student in Acoustics Lab at Aalto University, supervised by Vesa Välimäki and advised by Sebastian J. Schlecht.    

I explore how users perceive sounds in augmented reality (AR), especially for complex room acoustics. My PhD research goal is to model auditory illusion in augmented reality (AR) using statistical and machine learning approach. 

Prior to my Ph.D, I received B.S in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and M.S in [Music and Audio Computing Lab](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST.
