I am a 3rd-year Ph.D student in Acoustics Lab at Aalto University, supervised by Vesa Välimäki.    

I explore how users perceive sounds in augmented reality (AR), especially for complex room acoustics. Currently, my interest is to solve inverse problems in room acoustics with the Bayesian and data-driven approach.

Prior to my Ph.D, I received B.S in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and M.S in [Music and Audio Computing Lab](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST.
