I am a Ph.D student at Aalto Acoustics Lab, supervised by Vesa Välimäki and Sebastian Schlecht. My research area is audio for augmented and virtual reality. 
Prior to my Ph.D, I received B.S in [Computer Science](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/) and M.S in [Music and Audio Computing Lab](https://mac.kaist.ac.kr/) at KAIST.
