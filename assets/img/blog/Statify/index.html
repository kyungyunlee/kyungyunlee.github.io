My top tracks have high loundness, high energy and high danceability. Most of my tracks have vocals, so very low instrumentalness.</p> <p><img src="./top50.png" alt="image alt text"></p> <p>Features used</p> <ul> <li>Danceability: How danceable is the song?</li> <li>Energy</li> <li>Loudness</li> <li>Acousticness</li> <li>Liveliness: Is the song played live or recorded?</li> <li>Valence: Happy or sad?</li> <li>Instrumentalness: Does the song contain a lot of instruments or vocals?</li> <li>Popularity</li> <li>Tempo</li> </ul> <p>Also, you can see how different or similar your playlist is compared to other playlists.</p> <p><img src="./compare.png" alt="image alt text"></p> <p>Below is an embedding of tracks from both playlists. Each dot represents a track. If dots are closer together, it means those tracks are similar in terms of chosen audio features.</p> <p>Here you can see that “Today’s Top Hit” and my playlist of “Fav of 2020” are quite similar (I listened to a lot of popular pop in 2020.) The green dots are “NapCaviar” playlist, consisting of calm and mellow nap time songs. So, you see they are in a quite distinct space.</p> <p><img src="./graph.png" alt="image alt text"></p> <h4 id="how">How?</h4> <p><a href="https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Spotify API</a> offers various pre-computed audio features, such as danceability, instrumentalness and acousticness, for each track. All I did was to retrieve these data and plot them!</p> <h4 id="website">Website</h4> <p><a href="http://statify-with-spotify.herokuapp.com/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Here is the link again</a></p> <p>p.s.
